hello, if you are an employer and you are looking at this please know that i am reviewing git basics to make sure that if you do risk employing me that i leave nice commit comments so when i eventually break something we can rollback and pretend it never happened.

**i promise to commit often with meaningful messages and to only commit files that actually make sense to commit together**
